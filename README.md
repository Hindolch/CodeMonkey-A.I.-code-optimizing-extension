# CodeMonkey

CodeMonkey is a VSCode extension designed to optimize the code of the currently opened file. You can either select a specific block of code or run the command `CodeMonkey` via `Ctrl+Shift+P` to optimize the entire code file.

## Features

- **Code Optimization**: Optimize the code within the current file, making it cleaner and more efficient.
- **Selective Optimization**: Select a specific block of code to optimize by hovering over it.
- **Full File Optimization**: Run the `CodeMonkey` command (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) to optimize the entire file.

### Example:

If you select a code block, CodeMonkey will focus on optimizing only the highlighted section. Alternatively, running the `codeMonkey` command will optimize the entire file, ensuring consistency and efficiency across your project.

> Tip: Try running the optimization on large files to notice improvements in readability and performance!

## Requirements

- **Visual Studio Code**: Ensure you're using a compatible version of VSCode.
- **Node.js**: Some optimization processes might require Node.js as a dependency.

## Known Issues

- Some edge cases may cause errors during optimization for complex code blocks. If you encounter an issue, please report it on the GitHub repository.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0
- Initial release of the **CodeMonkey** extension.
